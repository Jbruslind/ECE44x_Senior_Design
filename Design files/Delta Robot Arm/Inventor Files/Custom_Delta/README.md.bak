## Custom Delta Assembly

This model is the top level assembly for all the other models. This includes 
smaller assemblies (such as the end effector, skelton, motor node and main PCB) as well 
as standalone components (such as the Delta Arm or Motor Mount). The model has been constrained 
so that it is possible to simulate simple movement for the delta end effector (in the vertical direction).

### Frame Skeleton 

This model is a sub assembly that creates the general skelton shape for the Delta robot. It uses 20/20 
aluminum T-slot extrusion to create a hexagon shape and is large enough to support the entire workspace 
area for the delta mechanism (as calculated by the Marginally Clever robotics Delta robot tool).

#### Acrylic Panel

The Acryic panel model was designed to be laser cut or CNC'd using typical 3 - 5 mm acrylic plates. This model was made to conform to 
the shape of the 60 deg 20/20 joint on the bottom portion of the panel and has 4 mounting holes on either side in order to provide stiffness 
to the overall frame.

#### Acrylic Panel Mounts

This model is the exact same as the Acrylic Panel but this was determined to be used for mounting various PCBs/main electrical elements (such as the power supply 
and Raspberry Pi).

#### T-slot Extrusion (350mm, 450mm)

There isn't really anything special about these models other than it is different lengths of 20mm T slot aluminum extrusion. This was the standard 
building material we used to create the frame.

The general drawing for 2020 Tslot extrusion is shown below (given in mm)

#### 60deg 20/20 Joint 

This part was a custom designed component that linked 3 T Slot extrusion profiles so that it created a 60 degree angle on the horizontal plane and a 90 degree 
angle with the vertical plane. 6 copies of this model allowed for the overall hexagon frame to take shape. This component was 3D printed using PLA material 
and was designed to withstand 4N of pushing force from either side (as shown in the simluation model)

### End Effector 

This assembly was created to help organize the end effector components. These components include the actual mechanical end effector mount, the suction cup
and nylon barb that will link the pnumatic hose.

#### End Effector V2

This is the actual mechanical mount model for the end effector. This was modeled after Fanuc M1ia Delta series robot end effector. The curved mounting joints 
were created so that there was an extra offset in the vertical direction (so that the end effector could read the bottom easily) and the material was shaped
so that there were strategic cutouts to preserve the structural integrity while saving material.

There are M3 mounting holes surrounding the end effector plate for easy mounting of any additional components. Originally I did not know what the 
PCB to control the suction cup feedback would look like so I put as many mounting holes as I could to accomodate.  

#### Vaccum Cup and Fitting 

The Vaccum Cup was bought from McMaster and specfied to be of 1/8" NPT pipe threads and to have a specific suction capability of at least 1.0 lbs. @ 24 in. of Hg.

#### Nylon Barb

The Nylon Barb model was also bought from Mcmaster to interface the 1/8" NPT pipe thread end of the suction cup to a 3mm nylon tube for the vaccum delivery.

#### End Effector PCB

The End Effector PCB was designed to interface a laser distance sensor (the VL53L1CXV0FY) to the main PCB. This sensor must be placed in a precise location 
in order to detect when the samples are present or not below the end effector. We can use this information to detect any mis handling of the samples or 
to dynamically determine how many samples are left (by measuring the distance of the sample stack). The PCB shape was design to mimic the End effector mechanical 
design as close as possible (using the given CircuitMaker tools)

### Motor Node 

### PetriFilm

PetriFilm was modeled just as a reference for the design of the system. It has been created to reflect the same color scheme and dimensions as actual Petrifilm
(specifically the anarobic bacterial film)
