#	Mechanical Files 

This directory contains all the information about the mechanical design of the project and the relevant files. A good ~90% of the modeling was done by the team itself, with a few models taken from online distributors or GrabCAD (great site, definitely should check it out). All the modeling was done using AutoDesk Inventor and are arranged into .ipt part files which go into .iam assembly files.

The file structure goes as: 

- Delta Robot Arm
	- PCB Files
		- End Effector Files
		- Main Board Files
		- Stepper Motor Board Files
- Project Model Files
	- Inventor Files
	- PetriFilm Model
